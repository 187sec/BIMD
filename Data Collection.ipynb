Item 1. Business. Corporate Overview \\'mktg, inc.\\' is a full service marketing agency. We develop, manage and execute sales promotion programs at both national and local levels, utilizing both online and offline media channels. Our programs help our clients effectively promote their goods and services directly to retailers and consumers and are intended to assist them in achieving maximum impact and return on their marketing investment. Our activities reinforce brand awareness, provide incentives to retailers to order and display our clients\\' products, and motivate consumers to purchase those products, and are designed to meet the needs of our clients by focusing on communities of consumers who want to engage brands as part of their lifestyles. Our services include experiential and face-to-face marketing, event marketing, interactive marketing, ethnic marketing, and all elements of consumer and trade promotion, and are marketed directly to our clients by our sales force operating out of offices located in New York, New York; Cincinnati, Ohio; Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; San Francisco, California; and London, England. \\'mktg, inc.\\' was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware in March 1992 and is the successor to a sales promotion business originally founded in 1972. \\'mktg, inc.\\' began to engage in the promotion business following a merger consummated on September 29, 1995 that resulted in Inmark Services becoming its wholly-owned subsidiary. On May 27, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with Aegis Lifestyle, Inc. a Delaware corporation (\"Aegis\") and Morgan Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Aegis (\"Merger Sub\"), pursuant to which Aegis will acquire all of our common stock for $2.80 per share in cash, or approximately $52 million, resulting in our becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aegis (the \"Merger\"). The Merger is subject to customary closing conditions including receipt of the approval of our stockholders, as well as the condition that we have available cash (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of at least $8,000,000 at the effective time of the Merger, less up to $2,000,000 in fees and expenses paid or incurred in connection with the Merger. Our Board of Directors has voted unanimously in favor of the Merger, which is expected to close in the third calendar quarter of 2014. There are no assurances that the Merger will be consummated. Our corporate headquarters are located at 75 Ninth Avenue, New York, New York 10011, and our telephone number is 212-366-3400. Our Web site is www.mktg.com. Copies of all reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission are available on our Web site. Premier Client Roster Our principal clients are large manufacturers of packaged goods and other consumer products. Our client partners are actively engaged in promoting their products to both the consumer as well as trade partners, (i.e., retailers, distributors, etc.), and include, among others, Diageo North America, Inc. and its affiliates (\"Diageo\"), Nike, Inc., Google Inc., The Procter & Gamble Company, Beats Electronics LLC, Nestle and Bayer HealthCare AG. For our fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, Diageo accounted for approximately 68% and 62%, respectively, of our revenues (inclusive of reimbursable program costs and expenses). As of both March 31, 2014 and 2013, Diageo accounted for approximately 55% of our accounts receivable. To the extent that we continue to have a heavily weighted sales concentration with one or more clients, the loss of any such client would have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Unlike traditional general advertising firms which are engaged as agents of record on behalf of their clients, as a promotional company, we are typically engaged on a product-by-product, or project-by-project basis. 3 Competition The market for promotional services is highly competitive, with hundreds of companies claiming to provide various services in the promotions industry. In general, our competition is derived from two basic groups: other full service promotion agencies, and companies which specialize in providing one specific aspect of a general promotional program. Some of our competitors are affiliated with larger general advertising agencies, and have greater financial and marketing resources available than we do. These competitors include Wunderman and OgilvyAction, which are subsidiaries of WPP Group; Momentum Worldwide and Jack Morton Worldwide, which are subsidiaries of IPG; and GMR Marketing a subsidiary of Omnicom Group. Niche independent competitors include Marketing Werks and Amp Agency. Employees We currently have approximately 340 full-time and 6,500 part-time employees. Our part-time employees are primarily involved in marketing support, program management and in-store sampling and demonstration, and are employed on an as needed basis. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Item 1A.Risk Factors. The proposed Merger with Aegis may disrupt our business and, if the Merger does not occur, our stock price may decline, we will have incurred significant expenses, and we may need to pay a termination fee to Aegis. As previously disclosed, on May 27, 2014, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Aegis pursuant to which Aegis will acquire all of our common stock for $2.80 per share in cash. The Merger, whether or not consummated, may result in a loss of key personnel and may disrupt our sales and marketing or other key business activities, which may have an adverse impact on our financial performance. The Merger Agreement in general requires us to operate our business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the Merger, but includes certain contractual restrictions on the conduct of our business that may affect our ability to execute on our business strategies and attain our financial goals. Additionally, the Merger, whether or not consummated, may impact our relationships with third parties, including our customers. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial financial advisory, legal, and other professional fees and expenses in connection with the Merger. However, as described in Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and in the Merger Agreement, completion of the Merger is subject to several conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock and Series D Preferred Stock voting as separate classes, (ii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting or restraining the Merger, (iii) exercise of dissenters\\' rights by holders of no more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, and (iv) that we have available cash (as provided for in the Merger Agreement) of not less than $8,000,000 at the effective time of the Merger, less up to $2,000,000 in fees and expenses paid or incurred in connection with the Merger. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Merger will be consummated. Prior to the announcement of the Merger, the last sales price of our common stock was $1.05. The current price of our stock may reflect an assumption that the pending Merger will occur, and the failure to complete the Merger could result in a decline in the price of our common stock to its prior trading levels. Aegis may terminate the Merger Agreement if we enter into, or publicly propose to enter into, an agreement relating to our acquisition by a third party or if we take other specified actions which are inconsistent with supporting the Merger. Similarly we can terminate the Merger Agreement, subject to certain restrictions, if our Board of Directors determines that it has received a superior acquisition proposal from a third party. In the event of a termination of the Merger Agreement in these instances, we would be required to pay Aegis a break-up fee of $2.08 million. In addition, the Merger Agreement also provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement as a result of the failure of our stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement, we will pay Aegis an amount equal to its reasonably documented transaction related expenses in an amount not to exceed $500,000. Concentration of Customers. A substantial portion of our sales has been dependent on one client or a limited concentration of clients. In particular, Diageo accounted for approximately 68% and 62% of our revenues for each of our fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively and accounted for 55% of our accounts receivable at March 31, 2014. In addition, our second largest customer accounted for approximately 10% and 15% of our revenues for each of our fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and accounted for 10% of our accounts receivable at March 31, 2014. To the extent such dependency continues, significant fluctuations in revenues, results of operations and liquidity could arise if Diageo or any other significant client reduces its budget allocated to the services we provide. Dependence on Key Personnel. Our business is managed by a limited number of key management and operating personnel. The loss of any one of those persons could have a material adverse impact on our business. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel. 4 Series D Preferred Stock Liquidation Preference; Redemption. In the event of our dissolution, liquidation or change of control, the holders of our Series D Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (\"Series D Preferred Stock\") will receive, in priority over the holders of Common Stock, a liquidation preference equal to the Stated Value of such shares plus the greater of (a) a 14% accreting liquidation preference, compounding annually, or (b) 3% of the volume weighted average price of the Company\\'s Common Stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (excluding the shares issued upon conversion of the Preferred Shares) for the 20 days preceding the event. A consolidation or merger, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and a sale of 50% or more of our Common Stock would be treated as a change of control for this purpose. Therefore, it is possible that holders of Common Stock will not obtain any proceeds upon any such event. After December 15, 2015, holders of the Series D Preferred Stock can require us to redeem the Series D Preferred Stock at its stated value plus any accretion thereon in the event such shares have not been converted to Common Stock at the same price per share payable upon a liquidation event. Control by Union Capital Corporation and holders of Series D Preferred Stock. Union Capital currently beneficially owns approximately 40% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock (assuming conversion and exercise of all securities issued in the December 2009 financing), including approximately 85% of our Series D Preferred Stock. The holders of our Series D Preferred Stock have the right to appoint two members of our Board of Directors. In addition, the vote of a majority of the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock is required to approve, among other things, (i) any issuance by us of capital stock which is senior to or pari passu with the Series D Preferred Stock; (ii) any increase in the number of authorized shares of the Series D Preferred Stock; (iii) any dividends or payments on equity securities; (iv) any amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or other governing documents that would result in an adverse change to the rights, preferences, or privileges of the Series D Preferred Stock; (v) any material deviation from the annual budget approved by our Board of Directors; and (vi) entering into any material contract not contemplated by the annual budget approved by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, Union Capital has substantial control over our business and can decide the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and can also prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Union Capital may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Third parties may be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire us because of this concentration of ownership. Anti-Dilution Provisions Of The Series D Preferred Stock Could Result In Dilution Of Stockholders. The conversion price of the Series D Preferred Stock is subject to weighted-average anti-dilution, so that upon future issuances of our Common Stock or equivalents thereof, subject to specified exceptions, at a price below the conversion price of the Series D Preferred Stock, the conversion price will be reduced, further diluting holders of our Common Stock. Unpredictable Revenue Patterns. A significant portion of our revenues is derived from promotional programs which originate on a project-by-project basis. Since these projects are susceptible to change, delay or cancellation as a result of specific client financial or other marketing and manufacturing related circumstantial issues, as well as changes in the overall economy, our revenue is unpredictable and may vary significantly from period to period. Competition. The market for promotional services is highly competitive, with hundreds of companies claiming to provide various services in the promotion industry. Some of these companies have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. We compete on the basis of the quality and the degree of comprehensive services which we provide to our clients. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with existing or future industry competitors. Economic Conditions. The prolonged weakness in the general economy has had and is likely to continue to have a negative impact on our business. We provide services to companies and industries that have experienced and may continue to experience financial difficulty. If our customers experience financial difficulty, we could have difficulty recovering amounts owed to us from these customers and demand for our services could decline. Recent Losses. We sustained net losses of approximately ($143,000), ($843,000), ($2,788,000) and ($4,893,000) for our fiscal years ended March 31, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Although we generated net income of $2,293,000, $1,215,000 and $5,399,000 for our fiscal years ended March 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and expect to continue to be profitable in the future, there can be no assurance in that regard. Lender\\'s Security Interest. At March 31, 2014, we had no loans outstanding under a $4,000,000 revolving credit facility. As security for our obligations under the credit facility, we granted the lender a first priority security interest in all of our assets. Under the credit facility, we are subject to customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants. The financial covenants require us to maintain a debt service coverage ratio (as defined in the loan agreement) of not less than 1.25 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal year, and that we have immediately available cash at all times, including borrowings under the credit facility, of at least $3 million. We were in compliance with these covenants at March 31, 2014. In the event of a default under the credit facility, our lender may demand the repayment of all outstanding principal and interest under the credit facility (if any), and may exercise all of its rights and remedies provided for under the loan agreements, and the rights and remedies of a secured party under applicable law. Although we expect to be able to comply with these covenants, there can be no assurance that we will do so. Risks Associated with Acquisitions. Part of our growth strategy is evaluating and, from time to time, consummating acquisitions and strategic transactions. These transactions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including: diversion of management\\'s attention from running our existing business; increased expenses, including legal, administrative and compensation expenses resulting from newly hired employees; increased costs to integrate personnel, customer base and business practices of the acquired company with our own; adverse effects on our reported operating results due to possible write-down of goodwill associated with acquisitions; and dilution to stockholders to the extent we issue securities in the transaction. 5 Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments.

Item 6.Selected Financial Data. Not Applicable. Item 7.Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. On May 27, 2014, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Aegis pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of Aegis will merge with and into us, resulting in us becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Aegis. See Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information. Critical Accounting Policies Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We believe the following represent our critical accounting policies: 7 Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are made when accounting for revenue (as discussed below under \"Revenue Recognition\"), depreciation, amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, fair value of derivative liabilities, valuation of stock options and equity transactions, income taxes and certain other contingencies. We are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary from estimates. We review all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effects of any adjustments when necessary. Revenue Recognition Our revenues are generated from projects subject to contracts requiring us to provide services within specified time periods generally ranging up to twelve months. As a result, on any given date, we have projects in process at various stages of completion. Depending on the nature of the contract, revenue is recognized as follows: (i) on time and material service contracts, revenue is recognized as services are rendered; (ii) on fixed price retainer contracts, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract; and (iii) on certain fixed price contracts, revenue is recognized as certain key milestones are achieved. Reimbursable program costs and expenses and outside production and other program costs associated with the fulfillment of certain specific contracts are accrued or deferred and recognized proportionately to the related revenue. Our business is such that progress towards completing projects may vary considerably from quarter to quarter. If we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed, or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time to satisfy our obligations under the contracts, then future profit margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized. Our outside production costs consist primarily of costs to purchase program merchandise; costs of production; merchandise warehousing and distribution; third party contract fulfillment costs; and other costs directly related to marketing programs. In many instances, revenue recognition will not result in related billings throughout the duration of a contract due to timing differences between the contracted billing schedule and the time such revenue is recognized. In such instances, when revenue is recognized in an amount in excess of the contracted billing amount, we record such excess on our balance sheet as unbilled contracts in progress. Alternatively, on a scheduled billing date, should the billing amount exceed the amount of revenue recognized, we record such excess on our balance sheet as deferred revenue. In addition, on contracts where reimbursable costs are incurred prior to the time revenue is recognized on such contracts, we record such costs as deferred contract costs on our balance sheet. Notwithstanding this, labor costs for permanent employees are expensed as incurred. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Our goodwill consists of the cost in excess of the fair market value of the acquired net assets of our subsidiary companies, Inmark Services, Optimum Group, U.S. Concepts, and Digital Intelligence as well as the assets of 3 For All Partners, LLC, d/b/a mktgpartners acquired by U.S. Concepts. These companies and businesses have been integrated into a structure which does not provide the basis for separate reporting units. Consequently, the Company is a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes. We also have intangible assets consisting of an Internet domain name and related intellectual property rights, and as of March 31, 2013, we had a customer relationship acquired from mktgpartners. At March 31, 2014 and 2013, our balance sheet reflected goodwill and intangible assets as set forth below: 2014 2013 Amortizable: Customer relationship $-- $80,422 Non-Amortizable: Goodwill $ 10,052,232 $ 10,052,232 Internet domain name 200,000 200,000 $10,252,232 $10,252,232 Total $10,252,232 $10,332,654 Goodwill and the internet domain name are deemed to have indefinite lives and are subject to annual impairment tests. Goodwill impairment tests require that we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. We are not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Upon completion of such review, if impairment is found to have occurred, a corresponding charge will be recorded. The value assigned to the customer relationship was amortized over a five year period and was fully amortized as of March 31, 2014. 8 Based on our assessment of qualitative factors which included an analysis of macroeconomic conditions, financial performance, and industry and market considerations, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test and that our goodwill was not impaired as of March 31, 2014. Goodwill and the intangible asset will continue to be tested annually at the end of each fiscal year to determine whether they have been impaired. Upon completion of each annual review, there can be no assurance that a material charge will not be recorded. Impairment testing is required more often than annually if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment or decline in value may have occurred. Accounts Receivable and Credit Policies The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects management\\'s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, management considers many factors in estimating its general allowance, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness, and economic trends. From time to time, management may adjust its assumptions for anticipated changes in any of those or other factors expected to affect collectability. Accounting for Income Taxes Our ability to recover the reported amounts of the deferred income tax asset resulting from net operating losses is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income during the periods over which such losses are deductible to reduce our tax expense in future periods. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers, in light of available objective evidence, whether it is more likely than not that some or all of such assets will be utilized in future periods. Results of Operations Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2014 Compared to March 31, 2013: Overview For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 we generated $2,830,000 in operating income, a $1,865,000 decrease over the $4,695,000 earned during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. This decline was the result of a $2,254,000 increase in compensation expense and an increase of $577,000 in general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a $966,000 increase in Operating Revenue. Our net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 was $2,293,000, which includes a $979,000 non-cash benefit for the fair value adjustment to the derivative financial instruments reflected on our balance sheet in connection with our December 2009 financing. The fair value adjustment is primarily attributable to the decline in the price of our Common Stock during Fiscal 2014, which under generally accepted accounting principles required us to decrease the carrying value of the Warrant derivative on our balance sheet and record the amount of such increase under \"Fair value adjustments to compound embedded derivative\" on our statement of operations. Our net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013 was $1,215,000, which includes a $1,660,000 non-cash charge for the fair value adjustment to the derivative financial instruments reflected on our balance sheet in connection with our December 2009 financing. A more detailed explanation of the accounting treatment for these non-cash charges is provided in Notes 5 and 8 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. The following table presents the reported operating results for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013: 2014 2013 Operations Data: Sales $ 139,029,000 $ 130,810,000 Reimbursable program costs and expenses (25,806,000) (23,004,000) Outside production and other program expenses (69,371,000) (64,920,000) Operating revenue 43,852,000 42,886,000 Compensation expense 33,121,000 30,867,000 General and administrative expenses 7,901,000 7,324,000 Operating income 2,830,000 4,695,000 Interest income, net -- 1,000 Fair value adjustments to compound embedded derivative 979,000 (1,660,000) Income before provision for income taxes 3,809,000 3,036,000 Provision for income taxes 1,516,000 1,821,000 Net income $2,293,000 $1,215,000 Per Share Data: Basic earnings per share $.28 $.15 Diluted earnings per share $.13 $.07 Weighted Average Shares Outstanding: Basic 8,283,656 8,289,132 Diluted 17,346,135 16,427,500 9 Operating Revenue and Modified EBITDA We believe Operating Revenue and Modified EBITDA are key performance indicators. We define Operating Revenue as our sales less reimbursable program costs and expenses, and outside production and other program expenses. Operating Revenue is the net amount derived from sales to customers that we believe is available to fund our compensation, general and administrative expenses, and capital expenditures. We define Modified EBITDA as income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization plus other non-cash expenses. Modified EBITDA is a supplemental measure to evaluate operational performance. Operating Revenue and Modified EBITDA are Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management to provide additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The following table presents operating data expressed as a percentage of Operating Revenue for each of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively: 2014 2013 Statement of Operations Data: Operating revenue 100.0% 100.0% Compensation expense 75.5% 72.0% General and administrative expenses 18.0% 17.1% Operating income 6.5% 10.9% Interest income, net 0.0% 0.0% Fair value adjustments to compound embedded derivative 2.2% (3.9%) Income before provision for income taxes 8.7% 7.0% Provision for income taxes 3.5% 4.2% Net income 5.2% 2.8% Sales. Sales consist of fees for services, commissions, reimbursable program costs and expenses and other production and program expenses. We purchase a variety of items and services on behalf of our clients for which we are reimbursed pursuant to our client contracts. The amount of reimbursable program costs and expenses, and outside production and other program expenses, which are included in revenues, will vary from period to period, based on the type and scope of the service being provided. Sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 were $139,029,000, compared to $130,810,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, an increase of $8,219,000, or 6%. This increase in sales was attributable to a $13,580,000 increase in sales from our largest customer, Diageo, and a $1,048,000 increase in interactive marketing revenues, offset by a $5,800,000 reduction in experiential marketing revenues, and a $609,000 decrease in trade marketing revenues. Reimbursable Program Costs and Expenses. Reimbursable program costs and expenses consist primarily of direct labor, travel and product costs generally associated with events we execute for Diageo. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, these expenses totaled $25,806,000, compared to $23,004,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. This $2,802,000 increase primarily reflects an increase in the number of events executed during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 versus the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. Outside Production and Other Program Expenses. Outside production and other program expenses consist of the costs of purchased materials, media, services, certain direct labor charged to programs, and other expenditures incurred in connection with and directly related to sales but which are not classified as reimbursable program costs and expenses. Outside production costs for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 were $69,371,000 compared to $64,920,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, an increase of $4,451,000, or 7%. This increase in outside production and other program expenses is primarily due to an increase in the number of Diageo events we executed, along with an increase in the cost of interactive marketing programs, partially offset by reductions in the cost of experiential, trade and interactive marketing programs. Operating Revenue. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, Operating Revenue increased $966,000, or 2%, to $43,852,000, compared to $42,886,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. This increase is primarily due to increases in our business with Diageo, along with an increase in interactive marketing revenue, partially offset by a decrease in experiential and trade marketing revenues. Operating Revenue as a percentage of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 was 32%, compared to 33% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. The decrease in the Operating Revenue percentage is a result of an increase in reimbursable program costs and expenses as a percentage of sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 versus the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. A reconciliation of Sales to Operating Revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 is set forth below. 10 Fiscal Year Ended March 31, Sales 2014 % 2013 % Sales - U.S. GAAP $ 139,029,000 100 $ 130,810,000 100 Reimbursable program costs and expenses, and outside production and other program expenses 95,177,000 68 87,924,000 67 Operating Revenue - Non-GAAP $43,852,000 32 $42,886,000 33 Compensation Expense. Compensation expense consists of the salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes and benefit costs related to indirect labor, overhead personnel and direct labor not otherwise charged to programs. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, compensation expense was $33,121,000, compared to $30,867,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, an increase of $2,254,000, or 7%. This increase is primarily the result of a $3,003,000 increase in salaries and a $549,000 increase in payroll taxes and employee benefits resulting mainly from staff increases, partially offset by a $1,277,000 decrease in bonus expense and an $87,000 decrease in share based compensation expense. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of office and equipment rent, depreciation and amortization, professional fees, insurance and other overhead expenses. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, general and administrative costs were $7,901,000, compared to $7,324,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013, an increase of $577,000 or 8%. This increase is primarily the result of a $486,000 increase in consultancy fees, a $187,000 increase in professional fees, a $141,000 increase in office expense, a $86,000 increase in new business expense, and a $66,000 increase in travel and entertainment expense, partially offset by a $223,000 reduction in depreciation and amortization expense, and a $169,000 decrease in promotion expense. Modified EBITDA. As described above, we believe that Modified EBITDA is a key performance indicator. We use it to measure and evaluate operational performance. Modified EBITDA for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 was $3,942,000, compared to $6,116,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. A reconciliation of operating income to Modified EBITDA for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 is set forth below. Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2014 2013 Operating income - US GAAP $2,830,000 $4,695,000 Depreciation and amortization 757,000 979,000 Share based compensation expense 355,000 442,000 Modified EBITDA - Non-GAAP $3,942,000 $6,116,000 Interest Income, Net. We had nominal net interest income for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013. Fair Value Adjustments to Compound Embedded Derivative. Fair value adjustments to compound embedded derivative for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 were $979,000 and ($1,660,000), respectively. These amounts consist entirely of a non-cash fair value adjustment to the derivative financial instrument] generated from the December 2009 financing. This adjustment is primarily attributable to the fluctuation in the price of our Common Stock during the relevant periods, which under generally accepted accounting principles required us to adjust the carrying values of the compound embedded derivative on our balance sheets and record the amount of such adjustments under \"Fair value adjustments to compound embedded derivative\" on our statements of operations. In general, an increase in the price of our Common Stock in a particular period will result in an increase in the carrying value of the derivative liability on our balance sheets at the end of such period and require us to record the amount of such increase as a charge under \"Fair value adjustments to compound embedded derivative\" on our statements of operations for such period, and a decrease in the price of our Common Stock in a particular period will have the opposite effect. A more detailed explanation of the accounting treatment for the derivative financial instrument is provided in Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. Income Before Provision for Income Taxes. The Company\\'s income before provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 increased $773,000 to $3,809,000, compared to $3,036,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. Provision for Income Taxes. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 the provision for income taxes was $1,516,000 compared to $1,821,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. 11 Net Income. As a result of the items discussed above, we generated net income of $2,293,000 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, an increase of $1,078,000, compared to $1,215,000 of net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. Diluted earnings per share amounted to $.13 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 versus $.07 per share for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2013. Liquidity and Capital Resources For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, working capital increased by $1,238,000 from $7,207,000 to $8,445,000, primarily as a result of the operating income we generated during the period. At March 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9,474,000, borrowing availability under our credit facility of $4,000,000, working capital of $8,445,000, and stockholders\\' equity of $12,190,000. In comparison, at March 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $11,240,000, borrowing availability under our credit facility of $3,198,000, working capital of $7,207,000, and stockholders\\' equity of $10,177,000. The $1,766,000 decrease in cash and cash equivalents during Fiscal 2014 was primarily due to $1,588,000 in property and equipment purchases, a $187,000 long-term investment, and $71,000 of cash used in operating activities, partially offset by a $112,000 positive effect on exchange rate changes to cash and cash equivalents. Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 was $71,000, attributable to a $6,001,000 increase in accounts receivable, a $1,381,000 decrease in accrued compensation, and $1,053,000 of cash used by the changes in operating assets and liabilities excluding accounts receivable, accrued compensation and deferred revenue, partially offset by a $4,858,000 increase in deferred revenue, net income of $2,293,000 plus $1,213,000 in net non-cash charges that consist of a reduction in our deferred income tax asset, depreciation and amortization expense, share based compensation expense, fair value adjustments to compound derivative, and deferred rent amortization. Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 was $1,776,000, resulting from $1,588,000 in property and equipment purchases, along with a $187,000 long-term investment. Financing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014 consisted of $32,000 in repurchases of our Common Stock from employees to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock. On November 23, 2011, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with TD Bank, N.A. (the \"Bank\"), pursuant to which we were provided with a $4.0 million revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). Borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, and have been guaranteed by our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, among other things: *All outstanding loans will become due on November 23, 2014, provided that following our request, the Bank may in its sole discretion agree to one year extensions of the maturity date; *Interest accrues on outstanding loans at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) 4.0%, and (ii) the Bank\\'s prime rate as from time to time in effect plus one percent; *Aggregate loans outstanding at any time are limited to a borrowing base equal to 80% of our eligible accounts receivable, as determined by the Bank, provided that the advance rate is limited to 50% with respect to accounts receivable from our customers whose receivables constitute more than 50% of our receivables in the aggregate; and *We are required to comply with a number of affirmative, negative and financial covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to pay dividends, provide that our debt service coverage ratio (as determined pursuant to the Loan Agreement) cannot be less than 1.25 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal year, and require that we have immediately available cash at all times, including borrowings under the Credit Facility, of at least $3 million. We were in compliance with these covenants at March 31, 2014. If we do not comply with the financial and other covenants and requirements of the Loan Agreement, the Bank may, subject to various cure rights, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement. In connection with the Loan Agreement, the holders of our Series D Preferred Stock entered into a Standstill Agreement with the Bank under which such stockholders have agreed not to exercise any rights they may have to cause us to redeem their shares of Series D Preferred Stock prior to December 15, 2015 (or such earlier date as the Credit Facility is terminated), other than upon a change of control or liquidation event of the Company. On December 11, 2012, we entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement, effective as of November 23, 2012, pursuant to which (i) the maturity date under the Loan Agreement was extended for one year to November 23, 2013, and (ii) our obligation to maintain $500,000 in a blocked account with the Bank to secure our obligations under the loan agreement was terminated. Accordingly, in connection with the amendment, such blocked account was released back to us. On November 14, 2013, the Loan Agreement was extended for another year to November 23, 2014. 12 We believe that cash currently on hand together with cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowing availability under the Credit Facility, will be sufficient to fund our cash and near-cash requirements both through March 31, 2015 and on a long term basis. We had no loans outstanding under the Credit Facility at March 31, 2014. Off-Balance Sheet Transactions We are not a party to any \"off-balance sheet transactions\" as defined in Item 301 of Regulation S-K. Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment In July 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2012-02, \"Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.\" Similar to ASU 2011-08, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 250) - Testing Goodwill for Impairment\", ASU 2012-02 addresses the growing cost and complexity of performing an analysis to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets (other than goodwill) for impairment. This ASU introduces qualitative factors which would simplify the analysis if facts and circumstances make it more-likely-than-not that impairment would not exist. Rather than requiring a purely quantitative impairment test, the ASU provides entities with the option to first examine qualitative factors to make this determination. Factors to be considered would include, but are not limited to: *Increases in interest rates, salaries, or other operating expenses, which would have a negative impact on future earnings or cash flows; *Recent financial performance and cash flow trends; *Aspects of the legal and regulatory environment which are expected to impact future cash flows, such as the Dodd-Frank Act; *Management turnover; *Economic and industry conditions. Entities are required by the guidance to consider both positive and negative impacts of such factors before determining whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% probability) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. It should be noted that the qualitative portion of the analysis is optional for all issuers. This ASU is effective for impairment tests performed during fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, and may be early adopted if the entity\\'s financial statements for the most recent fiscal or interim period have not yet been issued. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company\\'s operating results, financial position or cash flows. Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. ASU 2013-01 clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and receivables are not in the scope of ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. Specifically, ASU 2011-11 applies only to derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific criteria contained in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification(tm) (Codification) or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement. The FASB undertook this clarification project in response to concerns expressed by U.S. stakeholders about the standard\\'s broad definition of financial instruments. After the standard was finalized, companies realized that many contracts have standard commercial provisions that would equate to a master netting arrangement, significantly increasing the cost of compliance at minimal value to financial statement users. An entity is required to apply the amendments in ASU 2013-01 for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. An entity should provide the required disclosures retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. The effective date is the same as the effective date of ASU 2011-11. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company\\'s operating results, financial position, or cash flows. 13 Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications. Other comprehensive income includes gains and losses that are initially excluded from net income for an accounting period. Those gains and losses are later reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income. The amendments in this ASU do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. All of the information that this ASU requires already is required to be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements under U.S. GAAP. The new amendments will require an organization to: *Present (either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes) the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income - but only if the item reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. *Cross-reference to other disclosures currently required under U.S. GAAP for other reclassification items (that are not required under U.S. GAAP) to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period. This would be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income is initially transferred to a balance sheet account (e.g., inventory for pension-related amounts) instead of directly to income or expense. The amendments apply to all public and private companies that report items of other comprehensive income. Public companies are required to comply with these amendments for all reporting periods (interim and annual). The amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company\\'s operating results, financial position, or cash flows. Income Taxes: Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists In July, 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). U.S. GAAP does not include explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The amendments in this ASU state that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows. To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. This ASU applies to all entities that have unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date. Retrospective application is permitted. Management currently believes that the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on the Company\\'s operating results, financial position, or cash flows.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of \\'mktg, inc.\\' and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2014 and 2013, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. /s/ ParenteBeard

(2)Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a)Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. (b)Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts, fair value of derivative liabilities, valuation of stock options and equity transactions, and revenue recognition. Management bases its estimates on certain assumptions, which it believes are reasonable in the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. (c)Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company\\'s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, derivative financial instruments, the Company\\'s Senior Secured Notes (\"Secured Notes\") which were retired in 2012 and Series D Convertible Participating Stock (\"Series D Preferred Stock\") issued December 15, 2009. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities generally approximate their respective carrying values due to their current nature. Derivative liabilities, as discussed below, are required to be carried at fair value. The following table reflects the comparison of the carrying value and the fair value of the Company\\'s Series D Preferred Stock as of March 31, 2014 and 2013: March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 Series D Preferred Stock (See Notes 5 and 7): Carrying Values $3,848,272 $3,132,882 Fair Values $8,128,451 $8,413,532 The fair value of the Company\\'s Series D Preferred Stock has been determined based upon the forward cash flow of the contracts, discounted at credit-risk adjusted market rates. Derivative financial instruments - Derivative financial instruments, as defined in Financial Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 815 Derivatives and Hedging, consist of financial instruments or other contracts that contain a notional amount and one or more underlying features (e.g. interest rate, security price or other variable), require no initial net investment and permit net settlement. Derivative financial instruments may be free-standing or embedded in other financial instruments. Further, derivative financial instruments are initially, and subsequently, measured at fair value and recorded as liabilities or, in rare instances, assets. 22 The Company generally does not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash-flow, market or foreign-currency risks. However, the Company issued other financial instruments with features that are either (i) not afforded equity classification, (ii) embody risks not clearly and closely related to host contracts, or (iii) may be net-cash settled by the counterparty. As required by ASC 815, these instruments are required to be carried as derivative liabilities at fair value in the Company\\'s financial statements. See Notes 5, 7 and 8 for additional information. Redeemable preferred stock - Redeemable preferred stock (such as the Series D Preferred Stock, and any other redeemable financial instrument the Company may issue) is initially evaluated for possible classification as a liability under ASC 480 Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. Redeemable preferred stock classified as a liability is recorded and carried at fair value. Redeemable preferred stock that does not, in its entirety, require liability classification, is evaluated for embedded features that may require bifurcation and separate classification as derivative liabilities under ASC 815. In all instances, the classification of the redeemable preferred stock host contract that does not require liability classification is evaluated for equity classification or mezzanine classification based upon the nature of the redemption features. Generally, any feature that could require cash redemption for matters not within the Company\\'s control, irrespective of probability of the event occurring, requires classification outside of stockholders\\' equity. See Note 7 for further disclosures about the Company\\'s Series D Preferred Stock, which constitutes redeemable preferred stock. Fair value measurements - Fair value measurement requirements are embodied in certain accounting standards applied in the preparation of the Company\\'s financial statements. Significant fair value measurements resulted from the application of ASC 815 Fair Value Measurements to the Company\\'s Series D Preferred Stock, and Warrants issued in December 2009 as described in Note 8, and ASC 718 Stock Compensation to the Company\\'s share based payment arrangements. ASC 815 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Standard applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. ASC 815 further permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. At this time, the Company does not intend to reflect any of its current financial instruments at fair value (except that the Company is required to carry derivative financial instruments at fair value). However, the Company will consider the appropriateness of recognizing financial instruments at fair value on a case by case basis as they arise in future periods. (d)Cash and Cash Equivalents Investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase are considered cash equivalents. At March 31, 2014 the Company had approximately $9,220,000 of cash on hand in excess of FDIC insurance limits. (e)Accounts Receivable and Credit Policies The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by a valuation allowance that reflects management\\'s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. In addition to reviewing delinquent accounts receivable, management considers many factors in estimating its general allowance, including historical data, experience, customer types, credit worthiness, and economic trends. From time to time, management may adjust its assumptions for anticipated changes in any of those or other factors expected to affect collectibility. Account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote. (f)Unbilled Contracts in Progress Unbilled contracts in progress represent revenue recognized in advance of billings rendered based on work performed to date on certain contracts. (g)Deferred/Accrued Contract Costs Reimbursable program costs and expenses and outside production and other program expenses associated with the fulfillment of certain specific contracts are accrued or deferred and recognized proportionately to the related revenue. Notwithstanding the Company\\'s accounting policy with regard to deferred contract costs, labor costs for permanent employees are expensed as incurred. (h)Property and Equipment Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on furniture, fixtures, computer equipment and computer software is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset. Funds received from a landlord to reimburse the Company for the cost, or a portion of the cost, of leasehold improvements are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reductions to rent expense over the lease term. Minor repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred while costs that enhance the life of an asset are capitalized. 23 (i)Goodwill Goodwill consists of the cost in excess of the fair value of the acquired net assets of the Company\\'s subsidiaries. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests which require the Company to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless it determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company assesses the potential impairment of goodwill annually and on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Upon completion of such annual review, if impairment is found to have occurred, a corresponding charge will be recorded. The Company has determined that it has one reporting unit, and that a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test was not necessary. Based on such analysis, the Company did not identify any indication of impairment of its goodwill as of March 31, 2014. At March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company\\'s balance sheet reflected $10,052,232 of goodwill. (j)Intangible Assets Intangible assets include the value of a customer relationship and an internet domain name. The customer relationship intangible asset was amortized over its estimated economic life of five years and was fully amortized as of March 31, 2014. Amortization expense for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 for this asset amounted to $80,422 and $321,681, respectively. At March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company\\'s balance sheet reflected: March 31, 2014 Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net value Customer relationship $1,608,413 $1,608,413 $-- Unamortizable intangible asset: 200,000 -- 200,000 Internet domain name $1,808,413 $1,608,413 $200,000 March 31, 2013 Gross carrying amount Accumulated amortization Net value Customer relationship $1,608,413 $1,527,991 $80,422 Unamortizable intangible asset: 200,000 -- 200,000 Internet domain name $1,808,413 $1,527,991 $280,422 (k)Long-Term Investments Companies in which the Company has made an investment (referred to as \"investee companies\") which are not accounted for under the consolidation or the equity method of accounting are accounted for under the cost method of accounting. Under this method, the Company\\'s share of the earnings or losses of the investee company is not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet or Statement of Operations. However, impairment charges, if deemed necessary, are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. If circumstances suggest that the value of the investee company has subsequently recovered, such recovery is not recorded. See Note 4 for additional information. 24 (l)Long-Lived Assets In accordance with FASB guidance, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. The Company did not identify any indication of impairment of its long-lived assets as of March 31, 2014. (m)Revenue Recognition The Company\\'s revenues are generated from projects subject to contracts requiring the Company to provide its services within specified time periods generally ranging up to twelve months. As a result, on any given date, the Company has projects in process at various stages of completion. Depending on the nature of the contract, revenue is recognized as follows: (i) on time and material service contracts, revenue is recognized as services are rendered; (ii) on fixed price retainer contracts, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract; and (iii) on certain fixed price contracts, revenue is recognized as certain key performance criteria are achieved. Incremental direct costs associated with the fulfillment of certain specific contracts are accrued or deferred and recognized proportionately to the related revenue. Provisions for anticipated losses on uncompleted projects are made in the period in which such losses are determined. (n)Reimbursable Program Costs and Expenses Pursuant to contractual arrangements with some of its clients, the Company is reimbursed for certain program costs and expenses. These reimbursed costs are recorded both as revenues and as operating expenses. Such costs may include variable employee program compensation costs. Not included in reimbursable program costs and expenses are certain compensation and general and administrative expenses which are recurring in nature and for which a certain client fee arrangement provides for payment of such costs. These costs are included in compensation and general and administrative expenses on the statements of operations. The FASB released guidance on \"Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent\" and \"Income Statement Characterization of Reimbursements Received for \"Out-of-Pocket\" Expenses Incurred.\" Indicators identified by the Company for gross revenue reporting included: the Company is the primary obligor in customer arrangements, the Company has discretion in supplier selection, and the Company has credit risk. Accordingly, the Company records its client reimbursements, including out-of-pocket expenses, as revenue on a gross basis. (o)Deferred Rent Deferred rent consists of (i) the excess of the allocable straight-line rent expense to date as compared to the total amount of rent due and payable through such period, and (ii) funds received from landlords to reimburse the Company for the cost, or a portion of the cost, of leasehold improvements. Deferred rent is amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. (p)Accounting for Share Based Compensation In accordance with FASB guidance, the Company measures all employee share based compensation awards using a fair value method and records the related expense in the financial statements over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Excess tax benefits, as defined by FASB guidance, are realized from the exercise of stock options and are reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flow from operations. For each award that has a graded vesting schedule, the Company recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Share based employee compensation expense for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 was $354,669 and $442,115 respectively. 25 (q)Income Taxes The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and local income taxes that are currently payable. Deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. (r)Net Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding restricted shares. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the same basis, including if dilutive, common share equivalents, which include outstanding options, warrants, preferred stock and restricted stock. For the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, stock options to purchase approximately 70,000 shares of common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. The weighted average number of shares outstanding consist of: 2014 2013 Basic 8,283,656 8,289,132 Dilutive effect of: Options 1,162,576 212,424 Restricted stock 126,589 152,842 Warrants 2,454,166 2,453,954 Series D preferred stock 5,319,148 5,319,148 Diluted 17,346,135 16,427,500 (s)Recent Accounting Standards Affecting the Company Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment In July 2012, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2012-02, \"Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment.\" Similar to ASU 2011-08, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 250) - Testing Goodwill for Impairment\", ASU 2012-02 addresses the growing cost and complexity of performing an analysis to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets (other than goodwill) for impairment. This ASU introduces qualitative factors which would simplify the analysis if facts and circumstances make it more-likely-than-not that impairment would not exist. Rather than requiring a purely quantitative impairment test, the ASU provides entities with the option to first examine qualitative factors to make this determination. Factors to be considered would include, but are not limited to: *Increases in interest rates, salaries, or other operating expenses, which would have a negative impact on future earnings or cash flows; *Recent financial performance and cash flow trends; *Aspects of the legal and regulatory environment which are expected to impact future cash flows, such as the Dodd-Frank Act; *Management turnover; *Economic and industry conditions. Entities are required by the guidance to consider both positive and negative impacts of such factors before determining whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e. greater than 50% probability) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. It should be noted that the qualitative portion of the analysis is optional for all issuers. This ASU is effective for impairment tests performed during fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012, and may be early adopted if the entity\\'s financial statements for the most recent fiscal or interim period have not yet been issued. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company\\'s operating results, financial position or cash flows. Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. ASU 2013-01 clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and receivables are not in the scope of ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. Specifically, ASU 2011-11 applies only to derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with specific criteria contained in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification(tm) (Codification) or subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement. 26 The FASB undertook this clarification project in response to concerns expressed by U.S. stakeholders about the standard\\'s broad definition of financial instruments. After the standard was finalized, companies realized that many contracts have standard commercial provisions that would equate to a master netting arrangement, significantly increasing the cost of compliance at minimal value to financial statement users. An entity is required to apply the amendments in ASU 2013-01 for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. An entity should provide the required disclosures retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. The effective date is the same as the effective date of ASU 2011-11. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company\\'s operating results, financial position, or cash flows. Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, to improve the transparency of reporting these reclassifications. Other comprehensive income includes gains and losses that are initially excluded from net income for an accounting period. Those gains and losses are later reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income. The amendments in this ASU do not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements. All of the information that this ASU requires already is required to be disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements under U.S. GAAP. The new amendments will require an organization to: *Present (either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes) the effects on the line items of net income of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income - but only if the item reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. *Cross-reference to other disclosures currently required under U.S. GAAP for other reclassification items (that are not required under U.S. GAAP) to be reclassified directly to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period. This would be the case when a portion of the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income is initially transferred to a balance sheet account (e.g., inventory for pension-related amounts) instead of directly to income or expense. The amendments apply to all public and private companies that report items of other comprehensive income. Public companies are required to comply with these amendments for all reporting periods (interim and annual). The amendments are effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company\\'s operating results, financial position, or cash flows. Income Taxes: Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists In July, 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force). U.S. GAAP does not include explicit guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The amendments in this ASU state that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except as follows. To the extent a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use, and the entity does not intend to use, the deferred tax asset for such purpose, the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets. This ASU applies to all entities that have unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date. Retrospective application is permitted. Management currently believes that the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on the Company\\'s operating results, financial position, or cash flows. 27 (3)Property and Equipment Property and equipment consist of the following: March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 Furniture, fixtures and equipment $898,618 $844,435 Computer equipment and software 2,477,303 1,004,564 Leasehold improvements 3,911,743 3,852,910 7,287,664 5,701,909 Less: accumulated depreciation and amortization 4,889,230 4,215,223 Property and equipment, net $2,398,434 $1,486,686 Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 amounted to $676,342 and $657,730 respectively. The Company disposed of $2,335 worth of fully depreciated property and equipment during the year ended March 31, 2014. (4)Long-Term Investment On April 10, 2013, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Moving Off Campus, LLC, doing business as Bonfyre (\"Bonfyre\") to purchase a 2.0% interest in Bonfyre for $150,000. The investment in Bonfyre is accounted for using the cost method of accounting because the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over Bonfyre. Accordingly, the investment is adjusted only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, certain distributions and additional investments. Since the date of the initial investment the Company has provided $37,487 worth of services that in accordance with the stock purchase agreement constitutes additional investments. The carrying amount of the investment in Bonfyre at March 31, 2014 was $187,487. In October 2013, Bonfyre was converted into a corporation, Bonfyre Inc., of which the Company has a 7.3% interest in as of March 31, 2014. Management determined that there was no impairment of value at March 31, 2014. (5)Union Capital Financing Overview: On December 15, 2009, the Company consummated a $5.0 million financing led by an investment vehicle organized by Union Capital Corporation (\"UCC\"). In the financing, the Company issued $2.5 million in aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes which were repaid in full in November 2011, $2.5 million in aggregate stated value of Series D Preferred Stock initially convertible into 5,319,148 shares of Common Stock, and Warrants to purchase 2,456,271 shares of Common Stock (\"Warrants\"). As a condition to its participation in the financing, UCC required that certain of the Company\\'s directors, officers and employees (\"Management Buyers\") collectively purchase $735,000 of the financial instruments on the same terms and conditions as the lead investor. Aggregate amounts above are inclusive of Management Buyers amounts. The shares of Series D Preferred Stock issued in the financing have a stated value of $1.00 per share, and are convertible into Common Stock at an initial conversion price of $0.47. The conversion price of the Series D Preferred Stock is subject to weighted-average anti-dilution provisions. Generally, this means that if the Company sells non-exempt securities below the conversion price, the holders\\' conversion price will be adjusted downwards. Holders of the Series D Preferred Stock are not entitled to special dividends but will be entitled to be paid upon a liquidation, redemption or change of control, the stated value of such shares plus the greater of (a) a 14% accreting liquidation preference, compounding annually, and (b) 3% of the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (excluding the shares issued upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock) for the 20 days preceding the event. A consolidation or merger, a sale of all or substantially all of the Company\\'s assets, and a sale of 50% or more of Common Stock would be treated as a change of control for this purpose. After December 15, 2015, holders of the Series D Preferred Stock can require the Company to redeem the Series D Preferred Stock for cash at its stated value plus any accretion thereon (\"Put Derivative\"). In addition, the Company may be required to redeem the Series D Preferred Stock for cash earlier upon the occurrence of a \"Triggering Event.\" Triggering Events include (i) a failure to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Series D Preferred Stock, (ii) failure to pay amounts due to the holders (after notice and a cure period), (iii) a bankruptcy event with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iv) default under other indebtedness in excess of certain amounts, and (v) a breach of representations, warranties or covenants in the documents entered into in connection with the financing. Upon a Triggering Event or failure to redeem the Series D Preferred Stock, the accretion rate on the Series D Preferred Stock will increase to 16.5% per annum. The Company may also be required to pay penalties upon a failure to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon conversion of Series D Preferred Stock. 28 The Series D Preferred Stock votes together with the Common Stock on an as-converted basis except for matters which are required to be submitted to a class vote of the holders of Series D Preferred Stock. The vote of a majority of the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock is required to approve, among other things, (i) any issuance of capital stock senior to or pari passu with the Series D Preferred Stock; (ii) any increase in the number of authorized shares of Series D Preferred Stock; (iii) any dividends or payments on equity securities; (iv) any amendment to the Company\\'s Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws or other governing documents that would result in an adverse change to the rights, preferences, or privileges of the Series D Preferred Stock; (v) any material deviation from the annual budget approved by the Board of Directors; and (vi) entering into any material contract not contemplated by the annual budget approved by the Board of Directors. So long as at least 25% of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock issued at closing are outstanding, the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock as a class will have the right to designate two members of the Company\\'s Board of Directors, and so long as at least 15% but less than 25% of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock issued at the closing are outstanding, the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock will have the right to designate one member of the Board of Directors. Additionally, the holders of Series D Preferred Stock have the right to designate two non-voting observers to the Company\\'s Board of Directors. The Warrants to purchase 2,456,271 shares of Common Stock issued in the financing have an exercise price of $0.001 per share, subject to adjustment solely for recapitalizations. The Warrants may also be exercised on a cashless basis under a formula that explicitly limits the number of issuable common shares. The exercise period for the Warrants ends December 15, 2015. At the request of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock and exercise of the Warrants, if ever, the Company will be required to file a registration statement with the SEC to register the resale of such shares of Common Stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Upon closing of the financing, UCC became entitled to a closing fee of $325,000, half of which was paid upon the closing and the balance of which was paid in six monthly installments following the closing. The Company also reimbursed UCC for its fees and expenses in the amount of $250,000. Additionally, the Company entered into a management consulting agreement with Union Capital under which Union Capital provides the Company with management advisory services and the Company currently pays Union Capital a fee of $62,500 per year. The management consulting agreement will terminate when the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock no longer have the right to nominate any directors and Union Capital no longer owns at least 20% of the Common Stock purchased by it at closing (assuming conversion of Series Preferred D Stock and exercise of Warrants held by it). Accounting for the December 2009 Financing: Current accounting standards require analysis of each of the financial instruments issued in the December 2009 financing for purposes of classification and measurement in the Company\\'s financial statements. The Series D Preferred Stock is a hybrid financial instrument. Due to the redemption feature and the associated participation feature that behaves similarly to a coupon on indebtedness, the Company determined that the embedded conversion feature and other features that have risks associated with debt require bifurcation and classification in liabilities as a compound embedded derivative financial instrument. The conversion feature, along with certain other features that have risks of equity, required bifurcation and classification in their compound form in liabilities as a derivative financial instrument. Derivative financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value both at inception and an ongoing basis. The Company has used the Monte Carlo simulation technique to value the compound embedded derivative, because that model affords the flexibility to incorporate all of the assumptions that market participants would likely consider in determining the value for purposes of trading the hybrid contract. Further, due to the redemption feature, the Company is required to carry the host Series D Preferred Stock outside of stockholders\\' equity and the discount resulting from the initial allocation requires accretion through charges to retained earnings, using the effective method, over the period from issuance to the redemption date. The Company evaluated the terms and conditions of the Secured Notes under the guidance of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The terms of the Secured Notes that qualified as a derivative instrument were (i) a written put option which allows the holders of the Secured Notes to accelerate interest and principal (effectively forcing an early redemption of the Secured Notes) in the event of certain events of default, including a change of control of the Company, and (ii) the holders\\' right to increase the interest rate on the Secured Notes by 4% per year in the event of a suspension from trading of the Company\\'s Common Stock or an event of default. Pursuant to ASC 815-15-25-40, put options that can accelerate repayment of principal meet the requisite criteria of a derivative financial instrument. In addition, as addressed in ASC 815-15-25-41, for a contingently exercisable put to be considered clearly and closely related to the relevant instrument and not constitute a separate derivative financial instrument, it can be indexed only to interest or credit risk. In this instance, the put instruments embedded in the Secured Notes were indexed to events that were not related to interest or credit risk, namely, a change of control of the Company, and suspension of trading of the Company\\'s Common Stock. Accordingly, these features were not considered clearly and closely related to the Note, and bifurcation was necessary. 29 The Company determined that the Warrants should be classified as stockholders\\' equity. The principal concepts underlying accounting for warrants provide a series of conditions, related to the potential for net cash settlement, which must be met in order to achieve equity classification. The Company\\'s conclusion is that the Warrants are indexed to the Company\\'s common stock and meet all of the conditions for equity classification. The Company measured the fair value of the Warrants on the inception date to provide a basis for allocating the net proceeds to the various financial instruments issued in the December 2009 financing. The Company used the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation technique, because that method embodies, in its view, all of the assumptions that market participants would consider in determining the fair value of the Warrants for purposes of a sale or exchange. The allocated value of the Warrants was recorded to Additional Paid-in Capital. The financial instruments sold to the Management Buyers were recognized as compensation expense in the amount by which the fair value of the share-linked financial instruments (i.e. Series D Preferred Stock and Warrants) exceeded the proceeds that the Company received. The financial instruments subject to allocation were the Secured Notes, Series D Preferred Stock, Compound Embedded Derivatives (\"CED\") and the Warrants. Other than the compensatory amounts, current accounting concepts generally provide that the allocation is, first, to those instruments that are required to be recorded at fair value; that is, the CED; and the remainder based upon relative fair values. The following table provides the components of the allocation and the related fair values of the subject financial instruments: Allocation Fair Values UCC Management Buyers Total Proceeds: Gross proceeds $4,265,000 $735,000 $5,000,000 Closing costs (325,000) -- (325,000) Reimbursement of investor costs (250,000) (250,000) Net proceeds $3,690,000 $735,000 $4,425,000 Allocation: Series D Preferred Stock $2,670,578 $1,127,574 $233,098 $1,360,672 Secured Notes $2,536,015 1,070,519 363,293 1,433,812 Compound Embedded Derivatives (CED): Series D Preferred Stock $ 1,116,595 949,106 167,489 1,116,595 Secured Notes $28,049 23,842 4,207 28,049 Warrants $1,225,680 518,959 183,852 702,811 Compensation Expense -- (216,939) (216,939) $ 3,690,000 $735,000 $ 4,425,000 Closing costs of $325,000 were paid directly to the lead investor. As required by current accounting standards, financing costs paid directly to an investor or creditor are reflected in the allocation as original issue discount to the financial instruments. Fair Value Considerations: The Company has adopted the authoritative guidance on \"Fair Value Measurements.\" The guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, not adjusted for transaction costs. The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical asset or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3) as described below: Level 1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible by the Company. Level 2 Inputs - Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 Inputs - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including significant assumptions of the Company and other market participants. 30 The Company\\'s Secured Notes, Warrant derivative liability, Put option derivative and Series D Preferred Stock are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using unobservable inputs including significant assumptions of the Company and other market participants. In November, 2011, in conjunction with the Company obtaining a bank credit facility (see Note 6), the Company repaid in full the remaining $2 million of principal then outstanding under the Secured Notes. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2, or transfers in and out of Level 3 during the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013. The Company\\'s Series D Preferred Stock is a hybrid financial instrument. Due to the redemption feature and the associated participation feature that behaves similarly to a coupon on indebtedness, the Company determined that the embedded conversion feature and other features that have risks associated with debt require bifurcation and classification in liabilities as a compound embedded derivative financial instrument. The conversion feature, along with certain other features that have risks of equity, required bifurcation and classification in their compound form in liabilities as a derivative financial instrument. Derivative financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value both at inception and on an ongoing basis. As more fully discussed below, the Company has used the Monte Carlo simulation technique to value the compound embedded derivative, because that model affords the flexibility to incorporate all of the assumptions that market participants would likely consider in determining the value for purposes of trading the hybrid contract. Significant assumptions embodied in these methods are as follows: Market or Calculated Inputs Assumption: Level March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 Common stock trading market price 1 $ 1.20 $1.35 Common stock trading volatility: Preferred Compound Embedded Derivative 1 33.25%--33.76% 55.98%--88.87% Preferred Compound Embedded Derivative (effective volatility) 3 33.20% 67.38% Warrant 1 -- -- Credit-risk adjusted yields: Periods ranging from one to three years 2 6.13%--7.43% 6.64%--7.40% Effective risk-adjusted yield 3 6.30% 6.96% Terms (years): Preferred Compound Embedded Derivative (effective term) 3 .665 1.10 Effective assumption amounts represent the effective averages arising from multiple input ranges utilized in the Monte Carlo Simulation Technique. The level designations represent the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value Except for those assets and liabilities which are required by authoritative guidance to be recorded at fair value in the Company\\'s balance sheet, the Company has elected not to record any other assets and liabilities at fair value. The following tables present the Company\\'s instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. Fair Value Measurements as of March 31, 2013 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Instruments: Compound Embedded Derivative $ 4,664,894 $-- $-- $ 4,664,894 Total Instruments $4,664,894 $-- $-- $4,664,894 Fair Value Measurements as of March 31, 2014 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Instruments: Compound Embedded Derivative $ 3,686,170 $-- $-- $ 3,686,170 Total Instruments $3,686,170 $-- $-- $3,686,170 31 The following table presents the changes in Level 3 Instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the twelve months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013: Compound Embedded Derivative Balance at, March 31, 2012 $ 3,005,319 Fair value adjustments 1,659,575 Balance at, March 31, 2013 4,664,894 Fair value adjustments (978,724) Balance at, March 31, 2014 $3,686,170 The fair value adjustments recorded for the Compound Embedded Derivative are reported separately in the Statement of Operations. (6)Bank Credit Facility On November 23, 2011, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with TD Bank, N.A. (the \"Bank\"), pursuant to which it was provided with a $4.0 million revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). Borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of Company\\'s assets and have been guaranteed by the Company\\'s subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, among other things: *All outstanding loans will become due on November 23, 2014, provided that following the Company\\'s request, the Bank may in its sole discretion agree to one year extensions of the maturity date; *Interest accrues on outstanding loans at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) 4.0%, and (ii) the Bank\\'s prime rate as from time to time in effect plus one percent; *Aggregate loans outstanding at any time are limited to a borrowing base equal to 80% of the Company\\'s eligible accounts receivable, as determined by the Bank, provided that the advance rate is limited to 50% with respect to accounts receivable from customers of the Company whose receivables constitute more than 50% of the Company\\'s receivables in the aggregate; and *The Company is required to comply with a number of affirmative, negative and financial covenants. Among other things, these covenants restrict the Company\\'s ability to pay dividends, provide that the Company\\'s debt service coverage ratio (as determined pursuant to the Loan Agreement) cannot be less than 1.25 to 1.0 as of the end of any fiscal year, and require that the Company have immediately available cash at all times, including borrowings under the Credit Facility, of at least $3 million. If the Company does not comply with the financial and other covenants and requirements of the Loan Agreement, the Bank may, subject to various cure rights, require the immediate payment of all amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement. Upon the closing of the Credit Facility, the Company paid a $30,000 commitment fee to the Bank plus its legal costs and expenses. On December 11, 2012, the Company entered into an amendment to the Loan Agreement, effective as of November 23, 2012, pursuant to which (i) the maturity date under the loan agreement was extended for one year to November 23, 2013, and (ii) the Company\\'s obligation to maintain $500,000 in a blocked account with the Bank to secure the Company\\'s obligations under the loan agreement was terminated. Accordingly, in connection with the amendment, such blocked account was released to the Company. On November 14, 2013, the Loan Agreement was extended for one year to November 23, 2014. At March 31, 2014, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and availability of $4,000,000. In connection with the Loan Agreement, the holders of the Company\\'s Series D Preferred Stock entered into a Standstill Agreement with the Bank under which such stockholders have agreed not to exercise any rights they may have to cause the Company to redeem their shares of Series D Preferred Stock prior to December 15, 2015 (or such earlier date as the Credit Facility is terminated), other than upon a change of control or liquidation event of the Company. 32 (7)Redeemable Preferred Stock Redeemable preferred stock consists of the following as of March 31, 2014 and 2013: March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013 Series D Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001, stated value $1.00, 2,500,000 shares designated, 2,500,000 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2014; redemption and liquidation value $4,245,472 at March 31, 2014 $ 3,848,272 $ 3,132,882 The Series D Preferred Stock is subject to accretion to its redemption value, through charges to equity, over the period from issuance to the contractual redemption date, discussed in Note 5, above, using the effective interest method. The redemption value is determined based upon the stated redemption amount of $1.00 per share, plus an accretion amount, more fully discussed below. For the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, accretion amounted to $715,390 and $563,535, respectively. (8)Derivative Financial Instrument The Company\\'s derivative financial instrument consists of a compound embedded derivative (\"CED\") that was bifurcated from the Company\\'s Series D Preferred Stock. The Preferred CED comprises the embedded conversion option and certain other equity-indexed features that were not clearly and closely related to the Series D Preferred Stock in terms of risks. The following table reflects the changes in fair value of the CED using the techniques and assumptions described in Note 5: Compound Embedded Derivative Balance at, March 31, 2012 $3,005,319 Fair value adjustments 1,659,575 Balance at, March 31, 2013 4,664,894 Fair value adjustments (978,724) Balance at, March 31, 2014 $3,686,170 Fair value adjustments are recorded in fair value adjustments to compound embedded derivative in the accompanying financial statements. As a result, the Company\\'s earnings are and will be affected by changes in the assumptions underlying the valuation of the derivative financial instrument. The principal assumptions that have, in the Company\\'s view, the most significant effects are the Company\\'s trading market prices, volatilities and risk-adjusted market credit rates. (9)Stockholders\\' Equity (i) Stock Options On July 1, 2002, the Company established the 2002 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \"2002 Plan\") providing for the grant of options or other awards, including stock grants, to employees, officers or directors of, consultants to, the Company or its subsidiaries to acquire up to an aggregate of 750,000 shares of Common Stock. In September 2005, the 2002 Plan was amended so as to increase the number of shares of Common Stock available under the plan to 1,250,000. In September 2008, the 2002 Plan was amended to increase the number of shares of Common Stock available under the plan to 1,650,000. Options granted under the 2002 Plan may either be intended to qualify as incentive stock options under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or may be non-qualified options. Grants under the 2002 Plan are awarded by a committee of the Board of Directors, and are exercisable over periods not exceeding ten years from date of grant. The option price for incentive stock options granted under the 2002 Plan must be at least 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, while the price for non-qualified options granted is determined by the Committee of the Board of Directors. At March 31, 2014, there were 70,000 options, expiring from April 2015 through September 2017, issued under the 2002 Plan that remained outstanding. The 2002 Plan terminated on June 30, 2012. On March 25, 2010, the stockholders of the Company approved the \\'mktg, inc.\\' 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2010 Plan\"), under which 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock have been set aside and reserved for issuance. The 2010 Plan provides for the granting to the Company\\'s employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors of stock options (non-statutory and incentive), restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and other performance stock awards. The 2010 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The exercise price per share of a stock option, which is determined by the Compensation Committee, may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. For non-qualified options the term of the option is determined by the Compensation Committee. For incentive stock options the term of the option is not more than ten years. However, if the optionee owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of the Company, the term of the incentive stock option will be no longer than five years. The 2010 Plan automatically terminates on February 22, 2020, unless it is terminated earlier by a vote of the Company\\'s stockholders or the Board of Directors; provided, however, that any such action does not affect the rights of any participants of the 2010 Plan. In addition, the 2010 Plan may be amended by the stockholders of the Company or the Board of Directors, subject to stockholder approval if required by applicable law or listing requirements. At March 31, 2014, there were options to purchase 2,412,097 shares of Common Stock, expiring May 2020, issued under the 2010 Plan that remained outstanding. Any option under the 2010 Plan that is not exercised by an option holder prior to its expiration may be available for re-issuance by the Company. As of March 31, 2014, the Company had options or other awards for 61,966 shares of Common Stock available for grant under the 2010 Plan. 33 On November 6, 2013, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the \"Employment Agreement\") with Charles Horsey, the Company\\'s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to the Employment Agreement Mr. Horsey was awarded a stock option to purchase 200,000 shares of the Company\\'s common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share that vests in equal installments over a five-year period. In addition, Mr. Horsey was awarded a stock option to purchase 400,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. This option vests only upon a Liquidity Event (as defined in the Employment Agreement) as follows: as to (i) 100,000 shares of common stock if the Liquidity Event results in consideration paid to the Company\\'s stockholders of at least $2.50 per share of common stock but less than $2.80 per share of common stock, (ii) 200,000 shares of common stock if such Liquidity Event results in consideration paid to the Company\\'s stockholders of at least $2.80 per share of common stock but less than $3.10 per share of common stock, (iii) 300,000 shares of common stock if such Liquidity Event results in consideration paid to the Company\\'s stockholders of at least $3.10 per share of common stock but less than $6.00 per share of common stock, and (iv) all 400,000 shares of common stock if such Liquidity Event results in consideration paid to the Company\\'s stockholders of $6.00 per share or more. These options had an estimated grant date value of $.65 per share and expire on October 30, 2023. The maximum contractual life for any of the options is ten years. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the value of stock options granted under FASB guidance. Because option-pricing models require the use of subjective assumptions, changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value of options. A summary of option activity under all plans as of March 31, 2014, and changes during the two-year period then ended is presented below: Weighted average exercise price Number of options Weighted average remaining contractual term Aggregate intrinsic value Balance at March 31, 2012 $0.48 2,814,302 8.06 $1,328,393 Granted $-- -- Exercised $0.43 (144,437) Canceled $0.43 (144,437) Balance at March 31, 2013 $0.49 2,525,428 7.05 $2,171,868 Granted $2.00 600,000 Exercised $-- -- Canceled $0.43 (43,331) Balance at March 31, 2014 (vested and expected to vest) $0.78 3,082,097 6.68 $1,294,481 Exercisable at March 31, 2014 $0.50 1,911,572 6.03 $1,338,100 Total unrecognized compensation cost related to vested and expected to vest options at March 31, 2014 amounted to $144,528 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.84 years. Total compensation cost for all outstanding option awards for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 amounted to $160,538 and $162,106, respectively. The Company did not record any compensation cost related to the Liquidity Event options described above as the condition for vesting was not probable as of March 31, 2014. (ii) Warrants At March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013 there were warrants outstanding to purchase 2,456,271 shares of common stock at a price of $.001 per share, which were issued in the December 2009 financing and expire December 15, 2015. The aggregate intrinsic value of the warrants outstanding at March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013 was $2,945,069 and $3,313,511, respectively. 34 (iii) Restricted Stock During the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company awarded 45,000 and 160,000 shares of Common Stock initially subject to forfeiture (\"restricted stock\") pursuant to the authorization of the Company\\'s Board of Directors and certain Restricted Stock Agreements under the Company\\'s 2010 Plan. As of March 31, 2014 the Company had awarded 1,179,556 shares (net of forfeited shares) of restricted stock under the Company\\'s 2002 Plan, 381,500 shares (net of forfeited shares) of restricted stock under the Company\\'s 2010 Plan, and 189,767 shares (net of forfeited shares) of restricted stock that were not issued under the Company\\'s 2002 or 2010 Plans. Grant date fair value is determined by the market price of the Company\\'s common stock on the date of grant. The aggregate value of these shares at their respective grant dates amount to approximately $2,654,873 and is recognized ratably as compensation expense over the vesting periods. The shares of restricted stock granted pursuant to such agreements vest in various tranches over one to five years from the date of grant. The shares awarded to employees under the restricted stock agreements vest on the applicable vesting dates only to the extent the recipient of the shares is then an employee of the Company or one of its subsidiaries, and each recipient will forfeit all of the shares that have not vested on the date his or her employment is terminated. A summary of all non-vested stock activity as of March 31, 2014, and changes during the two years then ended is presented below: Weighted average grant date fair value Number of shares Aggregate Intrinsic Value Weighted average remaining contractual term Unvested at March 31, 2012 $1.62 581,855 $535,307 2.06 Awarded $0.90 160,000 Vested $1.87 (197,739) Forfeited $0.88 (58,500) Unvested at March 31, 2013 $1.36 485,616 $655,582 1.70 Awarded $1.38 45,000 Vested $1.76 (209,739) Forfeited $0.89 (24,515) Unvested at March 31, 2014 $1.01 296,362 $355,634 1.76 Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock awards at March 31, 2014 amounted to $169,151 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.76 years. Total compensation cost for the stock awards amounted to $194,131 and $280,009 for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. (10)Income Taxes The components of the provision for income taxes from continuing operations for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: 2014 2013 Current: State and local $24,000 $158,000 Federal 19,000 70,333 International 20,000 -- 63,000 228,333 Deferred: State and local 244,000 171,501 Federal 1,236,000 1,420,753 International (27,000) 1,453,000 1,592,254 $ 1,516,000 $ 1,820,587 35 The differences between the provision for income taxes from continuing operations computed at the federal statutory rate and the reported amount of tax expense attributable to income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 are as follows: 2014 2013 Statutory federal income tax 34.0% 34.0% State and local taxes, net of federal benefit 6.8 9.1 Permanent differences (5.8) 21.4 Alternative minimum tax -- (6.3) International tax rate differential 1.9 -- Other 2.9 1.8 Effective tax rate 39.8% 60.0% The tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities that are included in the deferred tax assets and liability are as follows: 2014 2013 Deferred tax (liability) assets: Current: Allowance for doubtful accounts $119,084 $126,839 Accrued compensation 100,209 647,299 $219,293 $774,138 Non-current: Assets: Depreciation on fixed assets $59,994 $124,838 Amortization on intangible asset 396,741 407,464 Net operating loss carryforwards 755,450 1,169,280 Share-based payment arrangements 175,061 206,843 Other 342,813 504,075 $1,730,059 $2,412,500 Liability: Goodwill, principally due to differences in amortization $ (3,211,580) $ (2,995,866) $(3,211,580) $(2,995,866) Net deferred tax (liability) asset $(1,262,228) $190,772 At March 31, 2014, the Company had federal net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $1,555,000 that begin to expire on March 31, 2029, as follows: Fiscal Year End Amount 2029 $140,000 2030 1,415,000 $ 1,555,000 As of March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefit or open tax positions. It is the Company\\'s practice to include interest and penalties in tax expense. As of March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to income tax matters included in its provision for income taxes. The Company currently has no federal or state tax examinations in progress and is no longer subject to federal and state income tax audits by taxing authorities for years prior to March 2011. 36 (11)Significant Customers For each of the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, Diageo North America, Inc. (\"Diageo\") accounted for approximately 68% and 62% of the Company\\'s revenue, respectively. At both March 31, 2014 and 2013, Diageo accounted for 55% of the Company\\'s accounts receivable. For the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company\\'s second largest customer accounted for approximately 10% and 15% of the Company\\'s revenue, respectively. At March 31, 2014 and 2013, this customer accounted for 10% and 17% respectively, of the Company\\'s accounts receivable. (12)Employee Benefit Plan The Company has a savings plan available to substantially all salaried employees which is intended to qualify as a deferred compensation plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"401(k) Plan\"). Pursuant to the 401(k) Plan, employees may contribute up to 15% of their eligible compensation, up to the maximum amount allowed by law. The Company at its sole discretion may from time to time make discretionary matching contributions as it deems advisable. The Company\\'s current policy is to match its employee\\'s contributions to the 401(k) Plan at the rate of 50%, with the maximum matching contribution per employee being the lower of 2.5% of salary or $6,375 in any calendar year. For the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company made discretionary contributions of approximately $295,000 and $208,000, respectively. (13)Leases The Company has several non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for property, that expire through September 2018. Rent expense for the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 amounted to approximately $1,768,000 and $1,751,000, respectively. Future non-cancelable minimum lease payments under all of the leases as of March 31, 2014 are as follows: Year ending March 31, 2015 $ 2,136,000 2016 884,000 2017 195,000 2018 78,000 2019 39,000 Thereafter -- $3,332,000 (14)Employment Agreements In June 2008, upon the acquisition of mktgpartners the Company employed Charles Horsey, the principal member of mktgpartners, as its Chief Operating Officer. The Company subsequently entered into a three-year employment agreement with Mr. Horsey upon his appointment as the Company\\'s President. In May 2010, the Company further amended the agreement so that Mr. Horsey serves as the Company\\'s Chief Executive Officer in addition to its President. In November 2013, the Company entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. Horsey. The employment agreement, as amended, expires November 1, 2018, currently provides for an annual base salary of $500,000, and provides for annual and supplemental bonuses based on the achievement of fiscal year profitability targets established by the Company\\'s Board of Directors. Pursuant to the employment agreement, in the event that Mr. Horsey\\'s employment is terminated by the Company without \"Cause\" or by Mr. Horsey for \"Good Reason,\" Mr. Horsey will be entitled to a cash payment in the amount of $100,000 plus; 18-months\\' of his base salary; provided that if the Company\\'s EBITDA for the preceding four fiscal quarters is less than $5 million, such severance payments shall be equal to 12-months\\' of his base salary. (15)Related Party Transactions Charles Horsey, who was not then employed by the Company, but who is currently its Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, was mktgpartners\\' principal member. In July 2009, following the approval of the Company\\'s Audit Committee, which was based on mktgpartners\\' performance following the acquisition and other relevant factors, the cash of $750,000 that was placed into escrow at the time of the acquisition was released to mktgpartners. In addition, the entire share consideration consisting of 332,226 shares of common stock was released to mktgpartners in January 2010. As a condition to their participation in the December 2009 Stock financing, Union Capital required that directors, officers and employees collectively purchase $735,000 of the securities issued in the financing on the same terms and conditions as Union Capital. Directors, officers and employees participating in the financing included Marc Particelli, the Chairman of the Board of the Company at that time, who invested $500,000 in the financing, and Charles Horsey, who invested $200,000 in the financing. As a result of their respective investments, Mr. Particelli was issued a Senior Note in the principal amount of $250,000, 250,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock and a Warrant to purchase 245,627 shares of Common Stock; and Mr. Horsey was issued a Senior Note in the principal amount of $100,000, 100,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock and a Warrant to purchase 98,251 shares of Common Stock. 37 (16)Subsequent Events (i) Merger Agreement On May 27, 2014, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with Aegis Lifestyle, Inc. a Delaware corporation (\"Aegis\") and Morgan Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Aegis (\"Merger Sub\"). The Merger Agreement provides for, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, the acquisition of the Company by Aegis at a price of $2.80 per share in cash (the \"Merger Consideration\"). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the \"Merger\"), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Aegis. At the effective time of the Merger, except as set forth below, each share of the Company\\'s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be converted into the right to the Merger Consideration, including all shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Company\\'s Series D Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (\"Series D Preferred Stock\") which shall be converted into the Company\\'s common stock prior to the Merger. Shares held by stockholders who have properly exercised and perfected appraisal rights under Delaware law, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as provided under Delaware law. Shares owned by the Company, Aegis, Company subsidiaries or Merger Sub shall be canceled without payment. In addition, each of the Company\\'s warrants to purchase common stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the excess of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price with respect to such warrant. As a result of the Merger, each vested and unvested outstanding stock option under the Company\\'s equity plans or otherwise will be canceled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the excess of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price with respect to such stock option, provided, however, that that certain option to purchase 400,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share issued to the Charles Horsey, the Company\\'s Chief Executive Officer, which vests only upon a \"Liquidity Event,\" will be exchanged for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the excess of the Merger Consideration over the per-share exercise price only with respect to 200,000 shares subject to such stock option. The remaining shares subject to such option shall be canceled without payment. Each restricted share of common stock under the Company\\'s equity plans that is outstanding as of the closing date will vest and be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The payments pursuant to this paragraph are subject to any applicable withholding taxes. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties from both the Company and Aegis, and also contains customary covenants, including covenants providing for each of the parties to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated, and covenants requiring the Company to carry on its business in all material respects in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the closing of the Merger. The Merger Agreement also contains a \"no shop\" provision that, in general, restricts the Company\\'s ability to solicit third-party acquisition proposals, provide information to or engage in discussions or negotiations with third parties that have made or that might make an acquisition proposal, approve any third party acquisition proposal, or enter into any acquisition agreement relating to any third party acquisition proposal. The no shop provision is subject to a \"fiduciary out\" provision that allows the Company, under certain circumstances and in compliance with certain obligations, to provide information and participate in discussions and negotiations with respect to unsolicited written third-party acquisition proposals that the Company\\'s Board of Directors reasonably believes is likely to result in a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and to terminate the Merger Agreement and accept a Superior Proposal upon payment to Aegis of the termination fee discussed below. The foregoing is subject to Aegis\\' rights to offer terms that will cause the Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights and provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, a change in the recommendation of the board of directors of the Company or a termination of the Merger Agreement by the Company to enter into an agreement for a Superior Proposal, the Company will pay Aegis a cash termination fee of $2.08 million. The Merger Agreement also provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement as a result of the failure of Company\\'s stockholders to approve the Merger Agreement at the special meeting where the Company\\'s stockholders have voted on a proposal to adopt the Merger Agreement, the Company will pay Aegis an amount equal to its reasonably documented transaction related expenses in an amount not to exceed $500,000. 38 The completion of the Merger is subject to certain customary conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by holders of a majority of the Company\\'s common stock and Series D Preferred Stock, voting as separate classes; (ii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting or restraining the Merger, and (iii) exercise of dissenters\\' rights by holders of no more than 5% of the Company\\'s outstanding common stock. In addition, the obligation of Aegis to complete the Merger is subject to the condition that the Company shall have available cash (as provided for in the Merger Agreement) of not less than $8,000,000 at the effective time of the Merger, less up to $2,000,000 in fees and expenses paid or incurred in connection with the Merger. Each of the Company\\'s and Aegis\\'s obligation to complete the Merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (i) subject to specified standards, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party and (ii) performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. Aegis is a newly-formed indirect subsidiary of Aegis Media Americas, Inc., which has guaranteed the obligations of Aegis to pay the merger consideration under the Merger Agreement. The Merger is not conditioned upon receipt of financing by Aegis or Aegis Media Americas. (ii) Voting Agreement Concurrently and in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Aegis entered into Voting Agreements with Rutabaga Capital Management LLC, affiliates of Union Capital Corporation, and certain directors and members of management of the Company, including all of the holders of the Company\\'s Series D Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the Voting Agreements such stockholders agreed to vote their respective shares of common stock and Series D Preferred Stock (i) in favor of the adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Merger and each of the other actions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (ii) against any proposal or transaction in opposition to the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and (iii) against any other action or agreement that could reasonably be expected to interfere with or delay or adversely affect the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the Voting Agreement entered into by the holders of the Company\\'s Series D Preferred Stock, such stockholders agreed to convert (i) approximately 23.5% of their shares of Series D Preferred Stock into shares of the Company\\'s common stock prior to the record date for the Company\\'s special meeting of stockholders to consider the Merger, and (ii) their remaining shares of Series D Preferred Stock into shares of the Company\\'s common stock immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. The Voting Agreements terminate upon termination of the Merger Agreement and certain other specified events. Company stockholders party to the Voting Agreements hold an aggregate of approximately 45% of the shares of the Company\\'s common stock, as well as 100% of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock, that are expected to be outstanding as of the record date for the meeting of stockholders to be called to consider the adoption of the Merger Agreement. The Voting Agreements also restrict the transfer of shares owned by the stockholders parties thereto. Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A.Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of March 31, 2014. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2014. Management\\'s Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records, that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\\'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 39 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluates the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (1992 Framework), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\"). In accordance with these standards, management assessed and tested, on a sample basis, the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2014. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met and cannot detect all deviations. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of control can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or deviations, if any, within the Company have been detected. While we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are effective, in light of the foregoing, we intend to continue to examine and refine our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting to monitor ongoing developments in this area. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 11.Executive Compensation. Compensation Discussion and Analysis General The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the \"Committee\"), under its charter, is charged with, among other things, determining the cash and non-cash compensation of our executive officers, and exercising the authority of the Board of Directors with respect to the administration of our stock-based and other incentive compensation plans. Our compensation arrangements with those persons who served as our executive officers for all or part of Fiscal 2014 primarily reflect the individual circumstances surrounding the applicable executive officer\\'s hiring or appointment, as reflected in the employment agreements we entered into with those persons. The foregoing information is intended to provide context for the discussion that follows regarding our compensation arrangements with those persons who served as our executive officers for all or part of Fiscal 2014. Compensation Philosophy Our compensation programs are designed to align compensation with business objectives and performance metrics, enabling us to reward executives and other key employees who contribute to and maximize shareholder value. Our compensation strategy will utilize multiple compensation vehicles to balance institutional affordability and the ability to hire and retain top talent. Consistent with the foregoing, the Compensation Committee subscribes to the following principles: *We believe that the most effective compensation strategies are simple in design, straightforward in application and easy to communicate to management, investors and participants. *We will reward key talent who directly contribute to the achievement of our core business objectives, based upon evaluation of specific, measurable performance goals. *We believe that an incentive compensation award should be first dependent upon the profitability and performance of the company and second upon an individual\\'s achievement of measurable personal goals that are directly aligned with the company\\'s strategic and operational goals. *We believe that base salary should be the fixed portion of executive compensation and should be used to compensate individuals for expected, day-to-day performance. *We believe that the variable portion of executive compensation should consist of cash and equity (or equity-like) incentives, to be determined annually and tied directly to performance measures and executive retention. Role of Management Officers in Compensation Decisions The Committee makes all compensation decisions for executive officers. The Chief Executive Officer, together with other members of management, evaluate the performance of executive officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer), and the Chief Executive Officer then makes recommendations to the Committee with respect to annual salary adjustments, annual cash bonus awards and restricted stock grants. The Committee can exercise its discretion in modifying any recommended salary adjustments or discretionary cash or equity-based awards to executives. Principal Components of Compensation of Our Executive Officers The principal components of the compensation paid to our executive officers consist of: *base salary; *cash bonuses; and *equity compensation, generally in the form of stock options and awards of restricted stock. 43 Management Bonus Plan On May 12, 2010, upon the recommendation of the Company\\'s Compensation Committee, the Company\\'s Board of Directors approved a Management Bonus Plan. Pursuant to the Management Bonus Plan, the Company\\'s Chief Executive Officer and other employees of the Company selected by him are eligible to be paid annual cash bonuses from a bonus pool. The bonus pool is only funded to the extent specified EBITDA thresholds approved of by the Company\\'s Board of Directors are achieved, and the actual amount of the bonus pool in each year (if any) is determined by the amount by which such thresholds are exceeded. For Fiscal 2014, none of the bonus pool was funded as a result of the Company\\'s performance for the fiscal year. Other Benefits The Company believes that establishing competitive benefit packages for its employees is an important factor in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel. Executive officers are eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans, such as medical, dental, and the Company\\'s 401(k) plan, in each case on the same basis as other employees. During Fiscal 2014, consistent with the Company\\'s practice with respect to all of its employees, the Company provided matching contributions under its 401(k) plan. Other than the 401(k) plan offered to all of its eligible employees, the Company does not offer retirement benefits.

Item 13.Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS RELATED-PERSON TRANSACTIONS POLICY AND PROCEDURES We have a written Related-Person Transactions Policy that sets forth the Company\\'s policies and procedures regarding the identification, review, consideration and approval or ratification of \"related-persons transactions.\" For purposes of our policy only, a \"related-person transaction\" is a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which the Company and any \"related person\" are participants involving an amount that exceeds $50,000. Transactions involving compensation for services provided to the Company as an employee, director, consultant or similar capacity by a related person are not covered by this policy. A related person is any executive officer, director, or more than 5% stockholder of the Company, including any of their immediate family members, and any entity owned or controlled by such persons. Under the policy, where a transaction has been identified as a related-person transaction, management must present information regarding the proposed related-person transaction to the Audit Committee (or, where Audit Committee approval would be inappropriate, to another independent body of the Board) for consideration and approval or ratification. The presentation must include a description of, among other things, the material facts, the interests, direct and indirect, of the related persons, the benefits to the Company of the transaction and whether any alternative transactions were available. To identify related-person transactions in advance, the Company relies on information supplied by its executive officers and directors. In considering related-person transactions, the Committee takes into account the relevant available facts and circumstances including, but not limited to (a) the risks, costs and benefits to the Company, (b) the impact on a director\\'s independence in the event the related person is a director, immediate family member of a director or an entity with which a director is affiliated, (c) the terms of the transaction, (d) the availability of other sources for comparable services or products, and (e) the terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third parties or to or from employees generally. In the event a director has an interest in the proposed transaction, the director must recuse himself or herself form the deliberations and approval. The policy requires that, in determining whether to approve, ratify or reject a related-person transaction, the Committee look at, in light of known circumstances, whether the transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, as the Committee determines in the good faith exercise of its discretion. Director Independence The Board of Directors has determined that each of Richard L. Feinstein and Marc C. Particelli is an \"independent director\" as defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2). The Board of Directors has also determined that each of the members of its Audit, Compensation and Nominating Committees meets the independence requirements applicable to those committees prescribed by the Nasdaq Listing Rules and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as currently in effect. Item 14.Principal Accounting Fees and Services. Principal Accounting Firm Fees The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed to and accrued by the Company for Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 by ParenteBeard LLC. Fiscal 2014 Fiscal 2013 Audit Fees (for audit of annual financial statements and review of quarterly financial statements) $272,000 $268,000 Tax Fees (for federal, State and local tax compliance and planning) 65,000 60,000 All Other Fees (1) 23,000 34,000 Total $360,000 $362,000 (1) For Fiscal 2014 and 2013, these fees relate to the audit of the Company\\'s 401(k) plan and nonrecurring non-attest special projects. Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures The Audit Committee has adopted a policy requiring pre-approval by the Audit Committee of all services (audit and non-audit) to be provided to the Company by its independent auditor. In accordance with that policy, the Audit Committee approved all audit and non-audit services rendered to the Company by ParenteBeard LLC in Fiscal 2014 and Fiscal 2013 and has determined that the provision of non-audit services by such auditors was compatible with maintaining their independence. 49 PART IV Item 15.Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.
